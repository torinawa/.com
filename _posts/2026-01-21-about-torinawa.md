Torinawa came from a passion project to bring quality rope to the Toronto rope community at Birdhaus.

Conspiring with a number of talented and seasoned rope enthusiasts, I worked on selecting the rope manufacturer that created a product meant to be used for our purposes.

Koumanawa was just that company, their dedication to creating a safe, high quality, ethically sourced material led me to partnering and becoming their exclusive distributor in Canada.

We take that great product and import it in bulk so that we can break it up into lengths that we hand process with jojoba oil and soybean wax to create a premium shibari product.
